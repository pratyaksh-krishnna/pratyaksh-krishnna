🧠 Why I Build

Software isn’t just code — it’s leverage.

I work in this field because I’m fascinated by how systems at scale quietly power the world: APIs handling millions of requests, distributed systems coordinating asynchronously, and now — LLMs reasoning over unstructured knowledge.

We’re entering a phase where software doesn’t just execute instructions — it interprets intent. Generative AI is shifting interfaces from buttons to language. The developers who understand both systems engineering and AI orchestration will define the next decade of products.

That intersection is where I build.
